# ðŸ“˜ Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## ðŸš€ What are Data Structures?  
A **Data Structure** is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. It plays a crucial role in solving complex computational problems and is essential for coding interviews and competitive programming.

### **Types of Data Structures:**  
1. **Linear Data Structures** (Elements arranged sequentially)  
   - Arrays  
   - Linked Lists  
   - Stacks  
   - Queues  

2. **Non-Linear Data Structures** (Elements connected in a hierarchical manner)  
   - Trees  
   - Graphs  
   - Hash Tables

## ðŸ“Œ What are Algorithms?  
An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules to solve a specific problem. Efficient algorithms help optimize time and memory usage.

### **Types of Algorithm Paradigms:**  
- **Brute Force** â†’ Tries all possible solutions  
- **Divide and Conquer** â†’ Breaks a problem into smaller subproblems (e.g., Merge Sort)  
- **Greedy Algorithms** â†’ Makes the best possible choice at each step (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm)  
- **Dynamic Programming** â†’ Breaks problems into subproblems and stores results to avoid recomputation (e.g., Fibonacci Sequence)
